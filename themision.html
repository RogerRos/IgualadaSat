            <h2>What is CanSat?</h2>
            <p>Can-Sat is a project where teams design, build and supply a small satellite in a can to collect atmospheric data 🛰️. Satellites are launched in rockets up to 1 km high and recovered with parachutes 🚀. Each Can-Sat must meet specific conditions and develop an original secondary mission, to capture digital images 📸. Teams submit reports and videos to demonstrate their success, and the best will launch their satellites 🏆. The competition culminates with the selection of the winning teams, who advance to the national phase 🌍.</p>

            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>Mini but Powerful: Although the CanSat is the size of a soda can, it can carry out complex missions such as atmospheric data collection, aerial photography and even communication with other units. 🥫➡️🌐</p>

            <p>Homemade Rockets: CanSats are generally launched from amateur rockets or model rockets that can reach impressive heights, sometimes more than a kilometer in the air. 🚀🆙</p>
                
            <p>Own Parachute: After launch, the CanSat has to return to Earth safely using a parachute that the students design and test. It's a space mission style landing!   🎯</p>
                
            <p>International: There are CanSat competitions worldwide, where teams of students from different countries demonstrate their skills. This promotes international cooperation and intercultural learning. 🌍🤝</p>
                
            <p>Space Recycling: Many teams use recycled or low-cost materials to build their CanSats, encouraging innovation and sustainability. ♻️💡</p>
                
            <p>First Steps in Aerospace Engineering: For many students, designing a CanSat is their first experience in aerospace engineering, which can inspire future careers in the space sector. 🛠️🌌</p>
